Substituter

My first TS/React project

I mostly messed around to try and get comfortable with the syntax.

You can substitute ingredients in a recipe, that are of the same type.
In baking, the ratios of ingredients that do different jobs is important.
So it also checks to make sure that, when you substitute an ingredient in, the proper amount is used.

It also tells you the total calories, and how your choices affect the count.
