NOT REALLY FINISHED TO MY SATISFACTION YET .-.

Instructions:

1) click "swap out" to bring up alternate ingredients,
and see the amount needed if using that ingredient,
as well as the calories for that amount

2) total calorie amount will change according to the choice

3) click "I'm happy" to close menu


Notes:

might implement a thingy where it shows you old cal amount,
next to what it would be if you swapped out

I was implementing making the description appear when you
hover over an ingredient when swapping out
