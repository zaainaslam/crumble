1) what the fuck is going on with my loop in Recipe file? Why is ings not working
2) is "object is possibly undefined" a problem
3) what things do I really need to import? Do I need to import interfaces to use them as a type?
4) when passing function as prop, which data type to use?



Things to do:

move find ingredient function to recipes.ts
conversion
map??
desc
close all other ing menus other than open one
rerender all
only render alternative ings
